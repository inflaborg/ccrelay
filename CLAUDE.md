# Formatting and Linting Guidelines

Before committing code to the repository, you must always run the following commands:

* npm run format
* npm run lint

These commands ensure that the codebase remains consistently formatted and free of problematic code constructs.

If the linter reports any warnings or errors, you must fix them in the source code before creating a git commit. The code must be clean with no remaining linter errors.
